# CloudHealth Provider Examples

This directory contains a set of examples of managing various CloudHealth resources with Terraform. The examples each have their own README containing more details on what the example does.

To run the examples, you will need a CloudHealth account.

You will also need an API Key from CloudHealth. For more information, see [Getting Your API Key](http://apidocs.cloudhealthtech.com/#documentation_getting-your-api-key).
